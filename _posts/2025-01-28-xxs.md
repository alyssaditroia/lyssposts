Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks happen when hackers sneak harmful scripts into trusted websites. This usually happens because the website takes input from users and shows it on the page without checking or cleaning it properly.

When an unsuspecting user visits the site, their web browser runs the harmful script, not realizing it's dangerous. Since the script seems to come from a trusted website, it can access sensitive information like cookies or login details stored in the browser. It can even change how the website looks or works.
